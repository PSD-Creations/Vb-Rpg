Walking animation could be a simple sprite of two images that switch between each other when moving a.k.a a key is being pressed 
such as a the characters leg extending for one image and retracting back to normal for the other
.....
certain areas have "monsters" such as walking through tall grass in pokemon,     basically a trigger once a certain pixel space is entered by the sprite
.....
when encountering a monster buttons will be available to preform actions such as attack, heal ( health item maybe ), magic, ect
.....
story?
